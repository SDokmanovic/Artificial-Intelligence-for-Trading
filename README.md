# Artificial Intelligence for Trading
Repository for python coding projects completed during the [Artificial Intelligence for Trading Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-trading--nd880)

## Project 1 - Trading with Momentum:
* Implemented a momentum trading strategy on a universe of stocks. Tested the strategy's profitablity and performed a statistical test to conclude if there is alpha in the signal or not.

## Project 2 - Breakout Strategy:
* Implemented and evaluated a breakout trading signal. Ran statistical tests to assess the normality of the signal returns and identify outliers. The effect of filtering these outliers out was also assessed.

## Project 3 - Smart Beta & Portfolio Optimisation:
* Created two smart beta portfolios; one utilising fundamental data and the other utilising optimisations. Evaluated the performance of these portfolios by calculating their tracking errors with a benchmark. Calculated the turnover of these portfolios to assess the costs of rebalancing.

## Project 4 - Multi-Factor Model:
* Created multiple alpha factors and applied various techniques to evaluate their performance. Formulated an advanced portfolio optimisation problem that combined these alpha factors with a PCA risk model. Penalties were applied to the optimisation to limit concentration risks within the portfolio. Constraints were also incorporated on portfolio risk, leverage, market neutrality and factor exposures.

## Project 5 - Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP):
* Applied natural language processing on corporate 10k filings. The data was cleaned and underwent text processing, feature extraction and modeling. Sentiment word lists were used with bag-of-words and TF-IDF to generate company specific sentiments. Alpha factors were then created based on how these sentiments evolve over time and were evaluated using various techniques.

## Project 6 - Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks:
* Constructed and trained a deep neural network to process and interpret news data. The network included embedding and LSTM layers and was used for sentiment classification.

## Project 7 - Combining Signals for Enhanced Alpha:
* Combined multiple alpha signals together using a random forest for enhanced alpha. Applied various techniques to evaluate its performance and explored different solutions to the problem of overlapping samples.

## Project 8 - Backtesting:
* Built a realistic backtester that uses raw Barra data to generate alpha factors and risk factors. The backtester makes use of portfolio optimisations that consider transaction costs. Used performance attribution to identify the major drivers of the portfolioâ€™s profit-and-loss (PnL).
