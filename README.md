# Artificial Intelligence for Trading
Repository for python coding projects completed during the [Artificial Intelligence for Trading Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-trading--nd880)

## Project 1 - Trading with Momentum:
* Implemented a momentum trading strategy on a universe of stocks. Tested the strategy's profitablity and performed a statistical test to conclude if there is alpha in the signal or not.

## Project 2 - Breakout Strategy:
* Implemented and evaluated a breakout trading signal. Ran statistical tests to assess normality and conclude if there is alpha in the signal or not. Outliers were also identified and the effect of filtering these out was evaluated on the trading signal.

## Project 3 - Smart Beta & Portfolio Optimisation:
* Created two smart beta portfolios; one utilising fundamental data and the other utilising optimisations. Evaluated the performance of these portfolios by calculating their tracking errors with a benchmark. Calculated the turnover of these portfolios to assess the costs of rebalancing.

## Project 4 - Multi-Factor Model:
* Created multiple alpha factors and applied various techniques to evaluate their performance. Formulated an advanced portfolio optimisation problem that combined these alpha factors with a PCA risk model. Penalties were applied to the optimisation to limit concentration risks within the portfolio. Constraints were also incorporated on portfolio risk, leverage, market neutrality and factor exposures.

## Project 5 - Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP):
* Applied natural language processing on corporate 10k filings. The data was cleaned and underwent text processing, feature extraction and modeling. Sentiment word lists were used with bag-of-words and TF-IDF to generate company specific sentiments. Alpha factors were created based on how these sentiments evolve over time.
